## Introduction
Vision is one important aspect of human perception. Many real world tasks depend on visual data. This led to the development of deep learning models that can process visual data. Vision recognition also involves a lot of challenging yet interesting tasks such as image generation, video generation, image classification, object detection, image segmentation etc. This repository hosts deep neural network architectures for these tasks. The main purpose of this repository is to serve as a practitioner's guide to building an end-to-end industry grade deep learning model training pipeline. The repository also serves as a learning resource for beginners who are interested in learning about deep learning models for vision recognition.
